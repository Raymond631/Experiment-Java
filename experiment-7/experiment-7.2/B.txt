Since its launch in 1981, China Daily has grown to become the nation’s leading English-language newspaper. 

With a combined print, online and mobile readership of more than 350 million,
 it serves a vital role in telling the world about China, providing valuable insight into the world’s second-largest economy. 

Consequently, it is quoted more often by overseas media than any other Chinese publication.
